# Local Blog Node Project
  A local hosted, basic, blog website where you can create posts, edit them and delete them. The website is responsive, working both on desktop and mobile. There is no hosted version, but you can try it yourself by using the command on the command terminal after navigating to the project's folder: ```node .\index.js``` or you can use ```nodemon .\index.js``` if you have the npm package and plan on editing the code youself. Don't forget to run ```npm install``` before trying to run the project.
